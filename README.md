This repo holds my STA561 Machine Learning code and project. The project highlights randomized singular value decomposition methods compared to traditional SVD. There are some computational comparisons implemented in Python. The results show that RSVD methods are faster than SVD and power iterations significantly increase time to completion at a low accuracy cost.
